# Shuffle Workflows
These are workflows meant for [Shuffle](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle). After Shuffle 0.9.0, these are automatically searchable from within Shuffle itself. The goal is to start covering most common automation use-cases before creating niches for your needs.

## How to use them
These workflows can be imported and exported to and from Shuffle. Feel free to upload any workflow here you'd like to share with the community. They are not necessarily production ready yet, as most workflows have to be changed to fit other environments, but there are similarities

## Structure
We have a certain structure that is being defined. Most workflows will fit into three categories:
* Prepare: Actions ran automatically to move and/or enrich data.
* Response: Actions to be used to solve or further handle an incident.
* Testing: Used for testing. Checks if each part of the Shuffle ecosystem works or not.

## Categories
Each Workflow should long-term be fitted with one or multiple of these categories. These are currently split into eight (8), but may change over time as use-cases change or better options are found.
