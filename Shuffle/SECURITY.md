Security.txt: https://shuffler.io/.well_known/security.txt

When a >medium severity vulnerability is discovered, expect it to be fixed ASAP - please nag us until it is. Security is a top priority, and we expect you to keep us accountable.
In the case it makes sense, we'll further create a security advisory, and publish a new CVE for your new glorious finding.
